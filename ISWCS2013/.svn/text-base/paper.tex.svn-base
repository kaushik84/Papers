\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Cognitive radio first coined by Mitola \cite{mitola} in 1999,.... 
Cognitive Relay is a device that dynamically access the spectrum, to support wireless services operating indoor. The goal is accomplished through the fusion of sensing and medium access. 

The paper discusses the hardware and software implementation for the prototype. \\
\textit{The main targets for the paper.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Sensing algorithm: Scanning the primary user channels by regulating the RF parameters over the software. The sensing is performed using energy detection.}
\item \textit{The device access the channels and rank them according to their utilization probability. Medium access control}
\item \textit{The device performs a real test measurements by monitoring the GSM at 1800 MHz bands at our labs}
\end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:scenario} discusses the scenario for the cognitive relay. Section \ref{sec:dect} explains the detection technique involved for sensing. Section \ref{sec:imple} describes the implementation of the device. Finally, Section \ref{sec:mea res} presents the measurement results in a real scenario followed by Section \ref{sec:conc} which concludes the paper.

Fig. \ref{fig:scenario} depicts a scenario for the Cognitive Relay (CR). The CR has one antenna named \textit{oudoor antenna} which sits at the top of a roof or clamped at an elevated position and the other antenna named as \textit{indoor antenna} sits indoor and communicates with the devices registered for indoor usage. This positioning of the antenna simplifies the channel (reduces fading effect) between the PU and CR. This improves the probability of detection of the primary users. \\
The main challenge of the cognitive radio devices acting as SU is to avoid interference at the primary receiver (also when it is mobile) while using the PU spectrum. This is accomplished by sensing the activities between primary sender and primary receiver in a duplex mode (FDD / TDD), i.e, uplink as well as downlink. Second approach followed by a CR is to sense the presence of primary sender with a sensitivity far below primary receiver and while using the spectrum is to restrict the amount of power (dBm) emitted outside the region below the sensitivity of the primary receiver. One approach is to realize a Distributed Antenna System (DAS) to provide uniform distribution of power indoor. \\
CR as a part of the network is a win-win situation for the mobile network operator (MNO) acting as a SU, provides a coverage improvement to the devices indoor. And through cognitive sensing and accessing the PU channels, it offers capacity improvement. Such a network element must operate independently to the MNO and posses authority to make decisions for the SU of the spectrum. Through this device the MNO extends its frequency database therefore it is important for the CR exhibit software defined functionality, i.e., to configure its RF parameters. The CR must support frequency translations with minimum delay for link between the MNO element and the link to the indoor devices. Some of the existing techniques are Amplify and forward (AF) that performs frequency translation in the analog domain and Decode and Forward (DF) that decodes the received bits adding to the processing gain. The later approach improves the received $SNR$ on both sides, i.e., indoor devices and SU base station at the cost of latency. \\

The CR is connected to the MNO through a wireless backhaul thereby reduces the capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX). The CR may have the ability to support different radio access technology (RAT) in order to communicate with indoor devices based on different RAT.  \\

Coexistence of such a device in a interference limited environment is the next biggest challenge, i.e., its coexistence with other CRs following similar or different Radio Access Technologies (RAT), or belonging to the same or different network. CR should follow a cooperative approach because non-cooperative or greediness will increase the interference power beyond the expected norms to affect the primary communications.

\subsection*{Noise Calibration}
The theoretical noise floor is determined using (\ref{eq:theornoisefloor}) is the thermal noise power with added noise figure.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:theornoisefloor}
\begin{split}
\text{Noise floor} &= kTB  + \text{NF} \\
			  &= -121 + 8\\
			  &= -115 \text{ dBm} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Fig. \ref{fig:USRPCallib} demonstrate the physical interpretation of the digital values in terms of known input power.
