\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Cognitive radio first coined by Mitola \cite{mitola} in 1999,.... 
Cognitive Relay is a device that dynamically access the spectrum, to support wireless services operating indoor. The goal is accomplished through the fusion of sensing and medium access. 

The paper discusses the hardware and software implementation for the prototype. \\
\textit{The main targets for the paper.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Sensing algorithm: Scanning the primary user channels by regulating the RF parameters over the software. The sensing is performed using energy detection.}
\item \textit{The device access the channels and rank them according to their utilization probability.}
\item \textit{The device performs a real test measurements by monitoring the GSM at 1800 MHz bands at our labs}
\end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:scenario} discusses the scenario for the cognitive relay. Section \ref{sec:dect} explains the detection technique involved for sensing. Section \ref{sec:imple} describes the implementation of the device. Finally, Section \ref{sec:mea res} presents the measurement results in a real scenario followed by Section \ref{sec:conc} which concludes the paper.

\subsection*{Noise Calibration}
The theoretical noise floor is determined using (\ref{eq:theornoisefloor}) is the thermal noise power with added noise figure.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:theornoisefloor}
\begin{split}
\text{Noise floor} &= kTB  + \text{NF} \\
			  &= -121 + 8\\
			  &= -115 \text{ dBm} 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Fig. \ref{fig:USRPCallib} demonstrate the physical interpretation of the digital values in terms of known input power.

	Gain 	 & Th. Noise floor  & Noise Floor & Noise Figure  \\

	10   	 & -113 		    & -85 		  & 26 			  \\ \hline
	15   	 & -113 	    	& -85  		  & 26 		 	  \\ \hline

	30 + 23  & -119	    		& -118	      & 3			  \\ \hline

\begin{split}
